Recently I was thinking about making an app for the people, but not sure what kind of the app I would like to make. In China, most of the people are using the smart phone(iPhone/Android) during the day to day work and spending most of the time on the phone. More and more people are working on the app and making money from it. The app changed the way people live.

It's pretty hard to find some app or some business that people hasn't start to do yet in China, e.g. O2O, B2B, B2C, C2C, Sharing economy....and meanwhile almost each industry field has been involved.

From my personaly perspective, it might very hard to find a requirement point from the people. However the real challenge is how we resolve the problem by one simple app and how we could make it happen from online to offline. It is not only related to the technology, but also to the people who are needed during the whole process. So far I don't think I have the capability of managing all the necessary resources by myself.

But never mind, I would like start from the scratch and build one simple app first to resolve the requirment I think the people are having now. It's none business with the money, but my joy.

I will keep updating the thoughts and the notes in this personal blog.
